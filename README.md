# hi-world
_Hello, World! A meaningless repo for testing local git configuration and getting familiar with GitHub._

A different 'Hello World'
-------------------------
I'm lying, it's not. But at least I'll try to put an `Hi, world!` in a bunch of different programming languages.
Trying to remember x86 assembler ~~won't be easy~~ will be very fun.

### Scary ghosts coming back from the dead!
*It all started when I decided to learn Subversion a long time ago; then Git came out and I forgot everything about SVN.
Years passed, with me and Git living in peace... but now, a course at http://unipv.eu wants me to go back to Subversion for team software development.*

Now I have to start to remember, hoping that the [awesomeness of GitHub](https://github.com/blog/1178-collaborating-on-github-with-subversion) may help at least my colleagues to keep using SVN without switching to Google Code or SourceForge.

**Look at me! Look at me! I am bold!**
